      <h2>First Post</h2>
      <p> Hey everyone, this is my first post on my new little website. 
        I need to still add in stripe stuff and make it not look awful but let’s get down to something I’ve been obsessed with the past few days:
      </p>
      <p>
      LLMs are going to make robots not suck for once.  
      </p>
      <p>
      Explain? 
      </p>
      <p>
      Robots currently suck. There’s lots of reasons for this, but a big one is that we don’t speak the same language. 
      Humans deal with messy, vague, intuitive language, while robots deal with precise, exact code. 
      </p>
      <p>
      A computer will do exactly what you tell it to do. 
      </p>
      <p>
      No more.
      </p>
      <p> 
      No less.
