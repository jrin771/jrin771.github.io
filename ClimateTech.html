    <h1> A listing of controversial opinions </h1> 
    <p> We need more capital being deployed to currently minimum medium scale ideally large scale solutions rather than experimental R&D projects. </p> 
    <p> Experimental R&D is very important in the context of scientific progress and the "long run" but 2050 is fast approaching. </p> 
    <p> Less sci-fi more stupid stuff. If your plan to solve climate change requires 10000 moving parts and ASI to work then I have serious doubts (on the timescale of very large impact in 2050). </p> 
    <p> Fusion is not going to stop climate change. (Yet should still be researched at full throttle) Nuclear Fision will probably help though. </p> 
    <p> I don't care about the turtles. My paper straw doesn't matter when companies dump millions of barrels of oil into the ocean by accident. </p>
