    <h1> Welcome to <a href="https://github.com/jrin771/Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics/tree/main">the world's largest GitHub Repository on LLMs + Robotics. </a> </h1>
      <h2> Why did you make this?</h2>
      <p>Short answer: This is going to be a very transformative area in the next coming years and I want there to be an easy way for people of as many backgrounds as possible to learn what's going on.</p>
      <p>Longer answer: While other resources on this topic certainly exist, they were all scattered, not frequently updated, didn't have the best framework for being sustainable, etc. in my opinion so I made this as a way to organize the chaos. I'm right now trying to reach out to research groups, secure some form of funding and do other tasks to ensure that this is not just a repository but is run as a true resource for everyone in the AI and robotics communities.</p>
      <h2>Why do you only allow PRs?</h2>
      <p>I could’ve included options for emails or text messages or something like that but here are some of my objections:</p> 
      <p>Equity. If you have an idea it goes into the same queue as every other idea.</p> 
      <p>Organization.Instead of having to sort between 20 different places it’s all in one area.</p> 
      <p>Efficiency. Same structure and same location = much easier for me to make mass changes.</p> 
      <h2>Can I include this on my top 10 list of breakthroughs that will replace ChatGPT this week?</h2> 
      <p>Get a real job.</p> 
      <h2>What are you working on next?</h2> 
      <p>My next "big project" is diving into and then writing an intuitive line by line explanation of the famous lars blackmore paper detailing <a href="http://www.larsblackmore.com/iee_tcst13.pdf"> the Lossless Convexification of Nonconvex Control Bound and Pointing Constraints of the Soft Landing Optimal Control Problem. </a> </p>
      <p>With less words: How do big sky cylinder land on right spot and not blow up and not waste liquid that make cylinder go boom but only a little bit? answer: math.</p> 
    <p>(If any of you know 3Blue1Brown I would walk on fire to do a collaboration with him on this)</p>
      <h2>Do you have any advice?</h2>
      <p>Go outside and enjoy the weather.</p>
