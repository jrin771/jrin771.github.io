    <h1> Welcome to <a href="https://github.com/jrin771/Everything-LLMs-And-Robotics/tree/main">the world's largest GitHub Repository on LLMs + Robotics. </a
      
      <h2> Why did you make this?</h2>
      <p>I think the intersection of LLMs and Robotics is and will continue to be very cool.</p> 
      <p>Since this field is so cool, there should be more organized research, education, and outreach.</p> 
      <p>This is my contribution.</p> 
      <p>Furthermore, this is also part of an ongoing final project I’m doing for a class at Stanford called PWR1KA: The Rhetoric of Innovation.</p> 
      <h2>Why do you only allow PRs?</h2>
      <p>I could’ve included options for emails or text messages or something like that but here are some of my objections:</p> 
      <p>Equity. If you have an idea it goes into the same queue as every other idea.</p> 
      <p>Organization.Instead of having to sort between 20 different places it’s all in one area.</p> 
      <p>Efficiency. Same structure and same location = much easier for me to make mass changes.</p> 
      <h2>Can I include this on my top 10 list of breakthroughs that will replace ChatGPT this week?</h2> 
      <p>Get a real job.</p> 
      <h2>What are you working on next?</h2> 
      <p>My next "big project" is diving into and then writing a more intuitive line by line explanation of the famous lars blackmore paper detailing <a href="http://www.larsblackmore.com/iee_tcst13.pdf"> the Lossless Convexification of Nonconvex Control Bound and Pointing Constraints of the Soft Landing Optimal Control Problem. </a> </p>
      <p>With less words: How do big sky cylinder land on right spot and not blow up and not waste people money? answer: math.</p>
      <h2>Do you have any advice for students?</h2>
      <p>Go outside and enjoy the weather.</p>
