  <h2>The Finding Common Ground Project</h2> 
  <p><b>Day 2:</b>Yesterday, we launched, now have three responses which you can view here, and made a big spreadsheet of folks to talk to.</p>
  <p>We also put out a poll asking "If you're supportive but didn't contribute, what might make you contribute?"</p>
  <p><b>Day 1:</b>Today, I’m excited to announce the Finding Common Ground Project.</p> 
  <p>Our mission is to gather and display at least a thousand answers to this question before Election Day:</p>
  <p class="question">'What is a political issue that you could find common ground on and why?'</p>
  <p>I started this project out of frustration with how much of American politics focuses on division rather than constructive solutions.</p>
  <p>While I understand the reasons behind this, and I recognize that disagreement is essential in a democracy, I also believe that America needs to focus more on finding common ground. </p> 
  <p>I'm not willing to wait around for that to happen, so I’m asking for your help to make it a reality.</p> 
  <p><b>From now until Election Day I will be updating this page every day with your answers</b>, which you can send via email <a href="mailto:findingcommonground24@gmail.com">here</a> or by tagging our <a href="https://x.com/commongrnd24">X (@commongrnd24)</a> and <a href="https://substack.com/@findingcommonground24">Substack (Finding Common Ground)</a> accounts.</p>
  <p>If you want to learn more about the many sides of issues before contributing, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/politics-policy/">Pew Research Center’s resources</a> are a great place to start. I sincerely hope you’ll contribute.</p>
  <p>A single response may not seem like much, but it’s how real political progress happens—one step at a time, until our words become the foundation of necessary common ground.</p>
  <p>Thank you, and let’s get to work!</p>
