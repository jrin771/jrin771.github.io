  <h1>The Finding Common Ground Project</h1>  
  <p>Today, I’m excited to announce the Finding Common Ground Project, which seeks to find and display at least a thousand answers to this question before Election Day:</p>
  <p class="question">'What is a political issue that you could find common ground on and why?'</p>
  <p>I created this project out of frustration with how much of American politics is focused on division rather than on finding constructive solutions.</p>
  <p>Now, I’m not naive as to why this happens, and I do want to note that disagreement is both necessary and welcome in a functioning democracy.</p>
  <p>However, I also believe that finding common ground is necessary for a functioning democracy.</p>
  <p>Finding common ground is something worth fighting for.</p>
  <p>I’ll be updating this page daily until Election Day with your answers, which you can send via email or by tagging our <a href="https://x.com/commongrnd24">X (@commongrnd24)</a> and <a href=https://substack.com/@findingcommonground24> Substack (findingcommonground24) </a> accounts.</p>
  <p>If you want to learn more about the many sides of issues before contributing, Pew Research Center’s resources are a great place to start, and I truly hope you’ll contribute.</p>
  <p>A single response may not seem like much, but it’s how real political progress happens: one step at a time, over and over again, until our words become the foundation of a necessary common ground.</p>
  <p>Thank you, and let’s get to work!</p>
