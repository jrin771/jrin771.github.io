  <h1>Greetings&nbsp;Friend 你好呀</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Jacob Rintamaki. <br>
    I studied engineering physics at Stanford and worked as a SWE intern for
    <a href="https://eladgil.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elad Gil</a>.<br>
    I’m fascinated by extremes, frontier technology, the allocation problem, and oceans.<br>
    I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio.

    "Construction of extended structures with three-dimensional covalent bonding may be easy to conceive and might be readily accomplished, but only by using tools that do not yet exist. [25] In other words, the tool structures and other components cannot yet be built, but they can be computationally modeled. Modeling the thermodynamic stability of a structure (showing that it can, in principle, exist) does not tell one how to build it, and these arguments do not yet constitute a research strategy or a research plan." - NNI 2006 Triennial Review
