<p>Hi, I'm Jacob. </p>
<p>I'm a junior at Stanford studying engineering physics.</p> 
<p>Here are some questions I have (non-exhaustive list): </p> 
<ul>
  <li>How can we create more effective, novel public policy organizations? (FAI, IFP, Cicero, GrowSF, CaliforniaYIMBY, etc.) </li>
  <li>Is venture capital the best way to create innovation/innovative companies and if not what should we be doing instead? (besides FROs)</li>
  <li>What are good answers to the thiel question and the "what should I own given A(G/S)I is coming" question?</li>
  <li>Most top universities are lame but the students have immense potential; how can we better use them to do cool stuff? </li>
  <li>Where are the weird spots that the outliers (not just young people, all ages) go to?</li>
  <li>Bringing bright, foreign teenagers to the US tends to make them much more ambitious. It seems like Emergent Ventures is the only group doing it at scale. How do we do more of that? </li>
  <li>What separates the people who "break out" from those who don't? And how can we make more people "break out"? and then continue to keep "breaking out"? </li> 
  <li>I don't think there's a skill ceiling for networking, leadership, ambition, or courage. Given this, what should I be doing?</li> 
  <li>How do I double down more? (ex. I believe in AGI, thus, how do you make the biggest possible bet? Be creative!)</li> 
  <li>As always, what am I missing here?</li>
</ul>
