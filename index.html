    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm J(acob), a frosh at Stanford studying computer science, mathematics, and engineering. I like to do cool things and meet cool people.
    </p>
    <h2>About This Blog</h2>
    <p> I like writing about things. Someday I'll be replaced by an LLM. But for now the human remains.
    </p>
    <h2>Little Rewards I'm Giving Myself</h2>
    <p> On Day 7 Of Writing: Stripe Payments. (But in a "only if you want to" way not a WSJ blocking way) Why? I don't feel comfortable asking for support until I've written at least this much. Also I'm broke and in college.
    </p>
    <p> On Day 30 Of Writing: Twitter Blue. Why? Despite my mixed feelings about E I use twitter enough that this would probably be a net positive investment for me.
