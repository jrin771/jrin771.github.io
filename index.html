    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
    <p>I'm J(acob), a frosh at Stanford studying CS and Engineering with some math thrown in.</p>
    <p>I enjoy learning cool things, creating cool things, and meeting cool people.</p>
    <h2>How to contact me</h2> 
    My email is jrin at stanford dot edu (jrin@stanford.edu).
    <h2>Why do I have a blog?</h2>
    <p> I like writing about things. Someday I'll be replaced by an LLM. But for now the human remains. </p>
    <h2> My thoughts on AGI </h2> 
    <p> First off, "AGI is a vibe" not a convoluted proof (although those are cool)</p> 
    <p> Second I think that if the vibe of AGI is "this basically feels like a person" then it'll happen before 2030 </p>
    <p> My intuition for this is multimodality, recent explosions of public interest, funding, and usage in AI, and how GPUs are still getting better for now. </p> 
    <p> For ASI (Aritifical Superintelligence) I am much more bearish. Simulating what a person feels like vs being smarter than every human who is or has ever lived are very different tasks. </p> 
    <p> It would be very interesting (and perhaps deadly) to be proven wrong, but I don't think ASI will be here this decade. </p>
