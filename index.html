    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm J(acob), a frosh at Stanford studying some combination of math, cs, and engineering. I like to do cool things and meet cool people. </p>
    <h2>About This Blog</h2>
    <p> I like writing about things. Someday I'll be replaced by an LLM. But for now the human remains. </p>
    <h2>Little Rewards I'm Giving Myself</h2>
    <p> On Day 7 Of Writing: Stripe Payments. (But in a "only if you want to" way not a WSJ blocking way) Why? I don't feel comfortable asking for support until I've written at least this much. Also I'm broke and in college.</p>
    <p> On Day 30 Of Writing: Twitter Blue. Why? Despite my mixed feelings about E I use twitter enough that this would probably be a net positive investment for me. </p>
    <h2> My thoughts on AGI </h2> 
    <p> First off, "AGI is a vibe, not a lemma." </p> 
    <p> Second I think that if the vibe of AGI is "this basically feels like a person" then it'll happen before 2030 </p>
    <p> My intuition for this is multimodality, recent explosions of public interest, funding, and usage in AI, and how GPUs are still getting better for now. </p> 
    <p> For ASI (Aritifical Superintelligence) I am much more bearish. Simulating what a person feels like vs being smarter than every human who is or has ever lived are very different tasks. </p> 
    <p> It would be very interesting to be proven wrong, but I don't think ASI will be here this decade. Sorry lesswrong people. </p>
