  <h1>The Finding Common Ground Project</h1>  
  <p>Today, I’m excited to announce the Finding Common Ground Project.</p> 
  <p>Our mission is to gather and display at least a thousand answers to this question before Election Day:</p>
  <p class="question">'What is a political issue that you could find common ground on and why?'</p>
  <p>I started this project out of frustration with how much of American politics focuses on division rather than constructive solutions.</p>
  <p>While I understand the reasons behind this, and I recognize that disagreement is essential in a democracy, I believe that finding common ground is every bit as important.</p>
  <p>Finding common ground is something worth fighting for, and that’s exactly what this project is about.</p>
  <p>I’ll be updating this page daily with your answers until Election Day. You can contribute by sending your response via email to <a href="mailto:findingcommonground24@gmail.com">findingcommonground24@gmail.com</a> or by tagging our <a href="https://x.com/commongrnd24">X (@commongrnd24)</a> and <a href="https://substack.com/@findingcommonground24">Substack (Finding Common Ground)</a> accounts.</p>
  <p>If you want to learn more about the many sides of issues before contributing, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/topic/politics-policy/">Pew Research Center’s resources</a> are a great place to start. I sincerely hope you’ll contribute.</p>
  <p>A single response may not seem like much, but it’s how real political progress happens—one step at a time, until our words become the foundation of necessary common ground.</p>
  <p>Thank you, and let’s get to work!</p>
