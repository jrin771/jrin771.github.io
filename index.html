<p>My name is Jacob Rintamaki.</p>
<p>I frequently worry that there's something I'm missing.</p>
<p>Here is what I mean by that. Please tell me what else I’m missing.</p>
<ul>
<li>1) The shift from 1999 to 2000 is underdiscussed. Society wasn’t just entering a new century but a new millennium, and the build up to this created one of the most interesting intellectual scenes ever. Technologically, I believe that atomically precise manufacturing is still the most underrated discussed technology of that time, as it likely only costs 10m to run the necessary experiments to validate key building blocks, according to <a href=”https://x.com/philipturnerar/status/1994137791995994211/photo/1”>Philip Turner.</a> Psychologically, I’m still unsure what the most underrated artifact of this era is, but the mailing lists (extropians, cypherpunks, etc.) have had an immense downstream cultural impact on tech and the broader world.</li>
<li>2) The vast majority of technologists and commentators believe AI will approximate a “second internet” in terms of its impact. I believe this is false and that over the next 20 years our world will become unfathomably strange due to technological progress. I believe this because AI is unusually <a href=”https://x.com/WillManidis/status/1991498313896485155?s=20”>legible to capital.</a> Capital legibility is a terrifying thing (one would be unwise to underestimate it) and 20 years is plenty of time for that legibility to play out.</li>
