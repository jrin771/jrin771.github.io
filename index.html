  <p>At critical moments in time, you can raise the aspirations of other people significantly, especially when they are relatively young, simply by suggesting they do something better or more ambitious than what they might have in mind.</p>

  <p>This is in fact one of the most valuable things you can do with your time and with your life. - Tyler Cowen</p>
