<p>Hi, I'm Jacob.</p> 
<p>I'm a junior at Stanford University studying engineering physics. I also have a YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbdNkqhpDHdKxzdpiK42YQ">here.</a></p>
<p>I don't fully know what my life is going to go (which is not a fun thing to sit with), but here are some of the things I believe: </p> 
<p>1. Right now, for the next year, I believe that getting really good at making YouTube videos is the highest leverage thing that I can do for my future career. </p> 
<p>2. Thus, if you think you could help me with this, whether on the editing (writing, video, etc.) or distribution or sponsorship/subscription sides, please reach out to me at jrin at stanford dot edu. I would really appreciate it. </p>
<p>3. I would give this as advice to anyone reading, which includes myself, but it's ok to not have your entire life planned out.</p> 
<p>3a. However, it's not ok to not get up every day and work very hard making the world a better place. There's plenty of problems to be solved, so grab a shovel, and let's get to work. :) </p>
