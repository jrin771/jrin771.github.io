  <h1>Acknowledgements</h1> 
  <p>I’d like to start by thanking Luke Farritor, who has spent many late nights assisting me with this review. </p> 
  <p>I’d also like to thank Amir Tarkian, who has been extremely knowledgeable on matters of extreme vacuums. </p> 
  <p>I’d finally like to thank My [Anonymous] Landlord, Enze Chen, Adam Marblestone, Aydin Gocke, Teddy Ganea, Darson Chen, Victor Li, Lachlan Sneff, Lukas Suss, Mark Friedenbach, Leo Glikbarg, and Max Newport for their support. </p> 
  <p>If there is anyone I have forgotten, I profusely apologize. I could not have done this alone.</p>

  <h1>A Technical Review Of Nanosystems</h1>  
  <p>There are many directions I could have taken when writing this technical review.</p>
  <p>I chose to focus on refuting assumptions, discussing interesting ideas, and being concise.</p>
  <p>I chose not to focus on non-vacuum-based mechanosynthetic methods, which are better covered <a href="https://web.mit.edu/amarbles/www/docs/Bottleneck_analysis_positional_chemistry.pdf">here.</a></p>
  <p>I also did not check the mathematics for non-unusual ideas. (This includes standard quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, classical mechanics, etc.)</p>
  <h1>Preface</h1>  
  <p><b>Drexler’s Big Idea:</b> The end state of materials science, chemistry, microtechnology, and manufacturing is the precise molecular control of complex structures. In other words, <b>molecular nanotechnology.</b></p> 
  <p><b>Drexler’s Guided by Many Readers:</b> General science background, a student interested in a career in nanotechnology, a physicist, a chemist, a molecular biologist, a materials scientist, a mechanical engineer, or a computer scientist.</p>
  <p><b>Interesting Point:</b> If you look at this from just one perspective, it looks wrong. For example, to pure chemists or pure mechanical engineers, molecular nanotechnology looks wrong, but holistically, it works.</p>
  <p><b>Criticism of Criticism:</b> Some critics see bad nanotechnology designs proposed and then use that to discredit the entire field of molecular nanotechnology, among other things. This is a poor mindset from would-be critics.</p>
  <p><b>Good epistemics:</b> Drexler then has a section saying that “will be” vs. “would be”; he’s not doing false advertising about devices that do or don’t exist.</p>
  <p><b>Thoroughness:</b> Drexler explicitly lays out his approach to citations as “Boltzmann isn’t cited, and neither is novel nanomechanical stuff” (paraphrased), but he tries to cite as much as possible.</p> 
  <p><b>Apologies:</b> Drexler apologizes for being the theorist in an experimentally heavy field, because that’s the hard work that has yet to come.</p>

  <p>I believe that this chapter does not contain any unique insights relevant for this review. The relevant content regarding physics is discussed in the earlier chapters, while the relevant content regarding the assembly of nano, intermediate, and eventually macroscale systems is discussed in the later chapters. Readers interested in experiments would be better served by looking over the “Technical Issues” and “Experimentation Plan” sections of this review.</p>
