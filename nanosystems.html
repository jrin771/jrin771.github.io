  <h1>A Technical Review Of Nanosystems (Vol. I)</h1> 
  <h1>By Jacob Rintamaki</h1>
  <img src="images/nanofactory.jpg" alt="Broadway Boogie-Woogie">   
  <h1>Acknowledgements</h1> 
  <p>I’d like to start by thanking Luke Farritor, who has spent many late nights assisting me with this review, Amir Tarkian, who has been extremely knowledgeable on matters of extreme vacuums, and Anton Troynikov, who gave me the idea of shipping something rather than nothing. :)</p>  
  <p>I’d also like to thank My Current [Anonymous] Landlord, Enze Chen, Adam Marblestone, Aydin Gocke, Teddy Ganea, Darson Chen, Victor Li, Lachlan Sneff, Lukas Suss, Mark Friedenbach, Leo Glikbarg, and Max Newport for their support. </p> 
  <p>If there is anyone I have forgotten, I profusely apologize. I could not have done this/continue to do this alone.</p>
  <h1>tl;dr</h1> 
  <p>The math of Nanosystems seems to work (even if its not as fast/strong/etc. as the book suggests), yet only a handful of relevant physical experiments have been published.</p>
  <p>I’m going to go do more of these relevant physical experiments and put the results on <a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv</a>.</p>
  <p>My first experimental goal is to recreate <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5476#Abs1">this paper</a> (where the authors were able to write the letter X on a p(2 × 1) Cu(110):O surface by picking up and placing down Cu atoms).</p>
  <p>I would ideally like to have recreated this experiment by June 17th, 2024, 3 months after this review has been published, but that's <b>very, very, very, very ambitious.</b></p> 
  <p>However, sometimes <b>very, very, very, very ambitious</b> timelines can enable us to achieve the near-impossible.</p>
  <p>If you think you could help me achieve this <b>very, very, very, very ambitious</b> goal (via advice, connections, a larger garage/basement space (I'll pay rent!), UHV equipment, thin film equipment, sputtering equipment, more metrology equipment, step-up transformers (120V wall to 240V), etc.), old clean room stuff, etc. please email me at <a href="mailto:jrin@stanford.edu">jrin@stanford.edu</a> or DM me on Twitter/X at <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobrintamaki">@jacobrintamaki.</a></p>
  <p>Back to work now.</p>

  <h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1> 
  
  <p>When you hear the word "nanotechnology," what do you think of?</p>
  <p>To many materials scientists, the word nanotechnology conjures ideas of carbon nanotubes and ever-more-advanced semiconductor fabrication plants trying to cram billions of transistors onto AI chips.</p>
  <p>To some science fiction fans, nanotechnology looks more like a swarm of self-replicating robots that devour everything—a powerful predator.</p>
  <p>But to Eric Drexler, the author of Nanosystems, nanotechnology doesn't look like carbon nanotubes or killer robots but rather a super-fast 3D printer that could make many non-edible physical products atom by atom.</p>
  <p>Drexler calls this vision of nanotechnology APM (atomically precise manufacturing), and if it were invented, it would be one of the most important general-purpose technologies ever.</p>
  <p>Here's an example: if APM worked according to Drexler's calculations, then APM could produce non-edible physical products ten times faster than traditional manufacturing while also having the prices be ten times cheaper. Even better, the product would be of ten times higher quality than its original, typically manufactured version, while also being more sustainable than practically every other manufacturing process we have today. Finally, to make things even more absurd, it's likely that the "ten times" metrics I mentioned earlier are underrating the full potential of APM.</p>
  <p>Let me repeat that again: it's likely that the "ten times" metrics I mentioned earlier are UNDERRATING the full potential of APM.</p>
  <p>That's incredible, but we've only scratched the surface of what APM can do.</p>
  <p>In stories and research papers written by futurists such as <a href="https://bigthink.com/videos/ray-kurzweil-on-the-future-of-nanotechnology/">Ray Kurzweil</a>, <a href="https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/nanoecon.pdf">Robin Hanson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Diamond_Age">Neal Stephenson</a>, <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5hX44Kuz5No6E6RS9/total-nano-domination">Eliezer Yudkowsky</a>, <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.pdf">Nick Bostrom</a>, and others, APM could bring about an age of abundant wealth and scientific knowledge, allowing us to cure diseases, build ultra-powerful computers, and harness the full power of our sun for energy. However, some of these futurists warn of how APM could be utilized (particularly by advanced AI systems) to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yd0yQ9yxSYY">wipe out</a> all of <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.pdf">humanity</a>, but luckily <a href="http://apm.bplaced.net/w/index.php?title=Molecular_assembler_(disambiguation)">I don't think we have to worry about APM wiping out humanity.</a></p>
  <p>Yet, taking a step back, despite all of this attention from prominent tech futurists, there's surprisingly been very little technical content written about the true feasibility of APM in recent years, and what has been written is mostly of low quality. To make matters worse, there have also been almost no physical experiments with the goal of validating APM published in recent years.</p>
  <p>Now, this doesn’t mean that APM is impossible, since the theoretical foundations for computers and rockets were developed many decades before practical versions of either were built, but there’s still a lot of work left that has to be done to achieve APM.</p>
  <p>So then, let’s get started; we don’t have a moment (or atom) to waste.</p>

  <h1 id="reviewoverview">Review Overview</h1>  
  <p>There are many directions I could have taken when writing this technical review.</p>
  <p>I chose to focus on refuting assumptions, discussing interesting ideas, and being concise.</p>
  <p>I chose not to focus on non-vacuum-based mechanosynthetic methods, which are better covered (at least partially) <a href="https://web.mit.edu/amarbles/www/docs/Bottleneck_analysis_positional_chemistry.pdf">here, </a> but also because I don't believe that fork of the technology will lead to APM.</p>
  <p>(It's still quite interesting and should be pursued, however there's too much inherent stochastic-ness for me.)</p>
  <h1 id="preface">Preface</h1>  
  <p><b>Drexler’s Big Idea:</b> The end state of materials science, chemistry, microtechnology, and manufacturing is the precise molecular control of complex structures. In other words, <b>molecular nanotechnology.</b></p> 
  <p><b>Drexler’s Guided by Many Readers:</b> General science background, a student interested in a career in nanotechnology, a physicist, a chemist, a molecular biologist, a materials scientist, a mechanical engineer, or a computer scientist.</p>
  <p><b>Interesting Point:</b> If you look at this from just one perspective, it looks wrong. For example, to pure chemists or pure mechanical engineers, molecular nanotechnology looks wrong, but holistically, it works.</p>
  <p><b>Criticism of Criticism:</b> Some critics see bad nanotechnology designs proposed and then use that to discredit the entire field of molecular nanotechnology, among other things. This is a poor mindset from would-be critics.</p>
  <p><b>Good epistemics:</b> Drexler then has a section saying that “will be” vs. “would be”; he’s not doing false advertising about devices that do or don’t exist.</p>
  <p><b>Thoroughness:</b> Drexler explicitly lays out his approach to citations as “Boltzmann isn’t cited, and neither is novel nanomechanical stuff” (paraphrased), but he tries to cite as much as possible.</p> 
  <p><b>Apologies:</b> Drexler apologizes for being the theorist in an experimentally heavy field, because that’s the hard work that has yet to come.</p>

  <h1 id="ch16">Chapter 16: Paths to Molecular Manufacturing</h1>  
  <p>I believe that this chapter does not contain any unique insights relevant for this review. The relevant content regarding physics is discussed in the earlier chapters, while the relevant content regarding the assembly of nano, intermediate, and eventually macroscale systems is discussed in the later chapters. Readers interested in experiments would be better served by looking over the “Technical Progress” and “Experimentation Plan” sections of this review.</p>
