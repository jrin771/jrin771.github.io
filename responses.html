    <li>1. Jacob Rintamaki - "I support NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) reform, primarily to build more clean energy but also because I believe that many of the environmental regulations we put into place in the late 60s and early 70s are hindering more than helping in today's world. This would align me closer with the Democrat party position on NEPA reform but there is bi-partisan support for NEPA reform from a deregulation perspective, which I support."</li> 
    <li>2. Elle Griffin - "I recently wrote about employee ownership which has bi-partisian support in Congress. Both of these policies are supported by both sides. "Republican and Democrat representatives have worked together on the Employee Equity Investment Act (EEIA) that would utilize the existing SBIC program that currently provides loans for small businesses, to provide loans for much larger ones in the case that they are converting to an ESOP. The Act was introduced in the house and senate in May of 2023." </li> 
    <li>3. belkarx 0 - "human suffering is bad."</li>
