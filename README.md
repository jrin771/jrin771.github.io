what makes good orators? It's not the big language but if you scored them to music it would sound in-place rather than out of place 

Where are your dynamics, your tempo, your rythmn, motifs, it's almost a 1:1 analogy. 
Except I think instrumental music is to talk without words. 

good analogy for getting better: what are the scales of your profession? teaching to younger kids? listening to each other play  
there is such a thing as perfection and that is found in the violin
